These methods are designed to be convenient for common operations and often provide more functionality or customization options compared to their counterparts in the `np` namespace. For example, `mean()` is implemented as a method of NumPy arrays, allowing you to directly call `a.mean()` to compute the mean of the array `a`.\n","\n","2. **Using `np` namespace (`np.square(a)`)**: Other functions in NumPy are implemented as standalone functions in the NumPy namespace (`np`). These functions are designed to work with various types of inputs, not just NumPy arrays. Therefore, you need to explicitly specify the input as an argument to the function when using it. For example, `np.square()` is a standalone function that computes the element-wise square of an array. To use it, you need to pass the array `a` as an argument: `np.square(a)`.\n","\n","To determine which approach to use, you can consult the NumPy documentation or use auto-completion in your integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor. Typically, functions implemented as methods of NumPy arrays (like `mean()`, `sum()`, `max()`, etc.) are designed for convenience and readability when working directly with arrays, while functions in the `np` namespace are more general-purpose and can accept a wider range of
